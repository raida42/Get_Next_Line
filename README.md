# Get_Next_Line

This is a challenge to implement printf in C.

## Compilation
Your program must compile with the flag -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx. which will be used as the buffer size for the read calls in your get_next_line.
```
gcc tests/main.c -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
```
`./a.out <filename>`
